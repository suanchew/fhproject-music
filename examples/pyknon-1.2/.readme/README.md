# Making MIDI Music with Python

Extra materials and code for my talk "Making MIDI Music with Python: An Introduction to Music Theory" at PyDX 2015

_How does music theory organize rhythms and pitches, and how can we translate these fundamental units of music into code? Learn this and then use Pyknon, a basic music composition library, to manipulate note sequences and generate MIDI files of the results._

In the `examples` directory, you will find several example MIDI files that accompany the presentation slides, and the Python source files that generated them.
