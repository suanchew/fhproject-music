# Making Music using the Circle of Fifths

The principles of music composition and arrangement are represented visually in the _Circle of Fifths_. Using the fundamentals underlying the Circle of Fifths, our tool enables a musician to identify musical patterns that sound great together. Using mathematical transformations, the tool can also identify chord progressions and other techniques. By identifying and recommending ideal musical patterns, the tool offers the user various ways to compose and/or arrange a piece of music.

_What is the Circle of Fifths?_ The Circle of Fifths is a tool that helps musicians create harmonious tunes comprising of chords that sound pleasant together. It is a visual representation of the relationship between the 12 tones of the chromatic scale in classical or western music. It is so call “fifths” because the tonic distance between any pair of adjacent notes in the circle equals 5 tones. 
 
In this project, we use the Circle of Fifths to develop a tool that helps the user:
* understand key signatures, scales, modes etc.
* transpose music to a different key
* identify and link musical patterns

The tool will provide a visual representation of musical patterns identified based on the user’s inputs. Furthermore, using mathematical transformations, the tool can recommend chord progressions and other techniques.
